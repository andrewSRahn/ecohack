 <h2>About Us</h2>
<div>
<p>
Our innovative combination hardware-software solution permits users to install a weather-resistant Raspberry Pi box that monitors a series of data, including readings from an actual solar panel, the current pressure, humidity, temperature, and luminosity, and an anemometer to measure wind speed.  The data is transmitted over a custom OPC-UA server implementation through Predix Machine to a cloud-based PostgreSQL database that is reviewed by a Python-based analytics system, leading to new analyzed data in an additional Predix-Postgres database that is gathered and sent to our AngularJS user-interface through a RESTful web service.
